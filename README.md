Longcell is a package for single cell/Visium spot alternative splicing analysis. It accepts the single cell/Visium spot isoform quantification from Longcell-pre, and gives the analysis of highly viarable isoform identification, differential alternative splicing.

## Installation

The easiest way to get Longcell is to install it from Github:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yuntianf/Longcell",dependencies=TRUE)
```
